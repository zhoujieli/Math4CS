# Math4CS 
Resources and knowledge of essential Math for doing Computer Science research, with a focus on Linear Algebra, Probability,  Analysis, Structures, Proofs, Optimizations, etc. The short term goal of this project is to refresh my own memory on Math for doing some NLP/CV research. The long term goal is to consolidate the resources listed here into a short document for easier and quicker digestion. Feel free to pull request for suggestions and additions ü§òü§òüèªü§ò
